I used nodemon installed globally for the back-end.  
If you don't need nodemon, edit the script to "node server.js"  



cd back-end  
npm install  
npm run start

cd ../front-end  
npm install  
npm run dev



There has to be at least an admin in the database.  

Database name :  
tpblog  

Collections inside tpblog :
- posts
- users  
(use json files in db-data to put data in db)
