I used nodemon installed globally for the back-end.  
If you don't need nodemon, edit the script to "node server.js"  



cd back-end  
npm install  
npm run start

cd ../front-end  
npm install  
npm run dev



There has to be at least an admin in the database.  
Account creation is only made by a connected admin.
